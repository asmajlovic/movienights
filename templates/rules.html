        <h3>Movie night rules and regulations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You don't talk about the movie nights.</li>
            <li>You <b>do not</b> talk about the movie nights.</li>
            <li>Every Thursday, pick a flick, turn up, and watch it - that's it.</li>
            <li>El Presidente:
                <ul>
                    <li>Elected by members to preside over four shows.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shows can be postponed only with a majority approval of associated/relevant voting members.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Determines whether excuses are valid or piss-poor (see Excuses and Multiplier sections).</li>
                    <li>Responsible for movie night correspondence and admin during their term.</li>
                    <li>El Presidente is expected to be present for a movie night.  Failure to comply results in a multiplier adjustment, by the members present for that particular showing, to ANY permitted value deemed fit (see Multiplier section).</li>
                    <li>Eligibility (all criteria must be met):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A period of at least two terms must pass before the current El Presidente is eligible once again.</li>
                            <li>Members with a multipler score of one (or greater) are eligible for a presidential mandate.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Excuses:
                <ul>
                    <li>El Presidente to be informed and then determine if an excuse is valid (holiday, mum said 'no', pee-pee fell off).</li>
                    <li>Piss-poor excuses result in a single point drop of multiplier (see Multiplier section).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multiplier:
                <ul>
                    <li>El Presidente tracking current multiplier status and handing off to newly elected one.</li>
                    <li>Permitted multiplier values are between 0 and 5</li>
                    <li>Previous attendance increases movie selection voting multiplier by 1, up to the maximum permitted value.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intended to favour regularly attending members.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Movie list:
                <ul>
                    <li>Already fairly set as determined by the 'brain trust'.</li>
                    <li>Enough entries are already present in the list to last the next few years (or something to that effect), but if you really <u>really</u> think we're missing something please inform the other members and an ad-hoc discussion/vote can take place.</li>
                    <li>Selection (Doodle) process completed one day before showing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Movie selection:
                <ul>
                    <li>May occur immediately after the preceding show.</li>
                    <li>A program picks 5 titles that have not been shown in the past.</li>
                    <li>A title that has been a previous candidate will not be eligible again until a period of two shows has passed.</li>
                    <li>Each member may vote for a single title only.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Miscellaneous:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bear in mind it could get complicated if the group gets too big.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, refer to rule numbers one and two.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
